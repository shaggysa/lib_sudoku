## lib_sudoku

A python library for solving sudoku puzzles written in Rust.

It can read and solve 9 million puzzles in under 10 seconds.

## Installation

Currently, you must compile the source code yourself with maturin. To do this, simply install maturin with pip and run the command "maturin build --release" in the project folder.
It will generate a wheel in /target/wheels. To add this library to python, run "pip install target/wheels/lib_sudoku*.whl".

## Usage

At the moment, the only code available through python is the PuzzleReader class and the speedtest methods.

To run a speedtest, create a PuzzleReader object with the name of the puzzle file as a string ("puzzles.csv" if you want to use the default one) and pass the object into the speedtest function.

Note that enabling the "verbose" parameter will significantly slow the function down (>10Î¼s of non-solving time to <40ms in my case)
