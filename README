## Sudoku-Rust

A rusty take on my sudoku solving program.

It can solve 9 million puzzles in under 2 minutes.


To use, clone the repo and do "cargo run". This will solve the pre-supplied puzzles and report back on the time it spent.


If you want to solve you own puzzles, run the command "cargo run {file}". Note that the file must be a csv in the format puzzle,solution.
